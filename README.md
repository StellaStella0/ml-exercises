# ml-exercises
Simple ML exercises to test different libraries, models and their features. I used them to see what's possible on sample datasets from Kaggle. These are not full and polished projects, and they only serve as test files for some functions that I wanted to see in action. For performant, end-to-end projects, check other repositories. Mostly used sklearn, pandas and seaborn, there might be some additional ones so check the imports before running.

## Exercises & their purpose
- Wine quality prediction (GSCV, Pipelines, KNN)
- Heart failure prediction (Removing outliers & showcasing skewness, Random Forest)
- House price prediction (Transforming categorical data, reshaping columns, basic plot tests)
