# ml-exercises
Simple ML exercises to test different libraries, models and their features. I used them to see what's possible on sample datasets from Kaggle.
Mostly used sklearn, pandas and seaborn, there might be some additional ones so check the imports before running.

## Exercises & their purpose
- Wine quality prediction (GSCV, Pipelines, KNN)
- Heart failure prediction (Removing outliers & showcasing skewness, Random Forest)
